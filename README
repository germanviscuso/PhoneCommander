PhoneCommander allows you to send commands to your Android (2.2+) phone using C2DM.
It's a spin-off of project "Chrome to Phone" (http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone).
It consists of 3 modules:
1) An Android application (phonecommander-android)
2) A Google App Engine (GAE) for Java project (phonecommander-appengine)
3) A Chrome Extension (extension)

The Chrome extension allows you to sign-in with your Google account against the GAE server.
The Android client allows you to register your device with the GAE server using the same Google account on the phone.
Every time you send a command to the GAE server it gets redirected to the C2DM servers on Google which eventually dispatch a push message to your Android device.

For testing purposes the latest version of the GAE server is live here:
